# Salesforce Diagram Technology Package (Sparx EA)
This is a Sparx Enterprise Architecture custom technology package that provides a diagram and components that align with the Salesforce Architecture diagram style.

No Salesforce assets are actually included in this package, you can download icons and other resources from the various Salesforce links below.  

I will be including a BIMP file (GIMP batch automation) that allows you to take the icons you down load from Salesforce and generate ones that look like the ones in https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/ The downloaded icons are white with a transparent background by default.

### Collapsed Cards
<img src="/md-images/CollapsedCardSF.png" width="200" align="left"/>

These are standard collapsed cards with space in the top left corner for a icon.  Text value is held in the notes field of the object, it is also possible to change the colour.

The non Salesforce collapsed cards are the same apart from their default colour settings.  These can also be changed in the same way as the salesforce cards.

These cards have space for an icon, though these are just images that are added to the model separately.
